edit: guess not :p so i've gone on six or so dates with an infj over a 3 month period (she's pretty busy, and me too) and recently i feel like progress has been a little glacial. for a bit i thought she was warming up... she hates texting.  and yeah, she told me how picky she was about people recently and that normally she wouldn't give anyone the time of day. you would literally have to have an autism spectrum disorder. i would know.  not to mention you don't tell someone who is just friends how much you like them. that would be more than bizarre. it's kind of hard to get to the point of officially dating when you have no idea what is going on in her head. for all i know an attempt to kiss her would result in abject horror and assault... spoke to her last night, she essentially said she likes me a lot and would normally never make any time for people unless she was obligated to. but she also indirectly used the word friend but it... so i met an infj female a while back, and we've been out like five or so times on a date. they go well, we get along, everything seems nice. i find her very attractive and we have quite a bit in...
